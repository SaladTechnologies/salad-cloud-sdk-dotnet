## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously, and we appreciate your cooperation in disclosing vulnerabilities to us responsibly.

Instead, please do one of the following:

- Open a GitHub security advisory on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/salad-cloud-sdk-dotnet/security/advisories/new)
- Send an email to [`dev@salad.com`](mailto:dev@salad.com)

Please include as much information as you can provide to help us better understand the nature and scope of the issue.
