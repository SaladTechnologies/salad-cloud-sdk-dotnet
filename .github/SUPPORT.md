# Support

We use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/SaladTechnologies/salad-cloud-sdk-dotnet/discussions) for general chat and community-provided support. The community often chimes in with helpful advice when you have a question, and you may also find yourself providing answers and helping others. Be sure to review the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating.
